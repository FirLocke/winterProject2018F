          <h2>What are the Northern Lights?</h2>

          <p>The bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically
            charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere.

          The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres.
          They are known as 'Aurora borealis' in the north and 'Aurora australis' in the south..<br><br>

          Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common.
          Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and violet have been reported.

          The lights appear in many forms from patches or scattered clouds of light to streamers, arcs, rippling curtains or
          shooting rays that light up the sky with an eerie glow.

<h2>When and where is the best place to watch the Aurora?</h2>

<p>Well, you've come to the right place!

Because the phenomena occurs near the magnetic poles,
getting as close to these poles as possible will rapidly increase the chances of viewing aurora.

As the magnetic south pole is in Antarctica, unless your a scientist working there,
it usually leaves the northern hemisphere the most sensible option of viewing aurora.
It should be mentioned however that during strong solar storms, aurora australis are quite often visible in places
south from Australia. But generally speaking, the best places to watch the aurora are usually are North America or Europe.<br><br>

In North America, the north western parts of Canada,
particularly the Yukon, Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Alaska are favourable.

In Europe, Scandinavia, particularly the Lapland areas of Norway, Sweden and Finland is very good for aurora viewing.
Iceland is also a good place for auroras and Auroral displays can also be seen over the southern tip of Greenland.<br><br>

In terms of what physically makes a place good to view aurora aside from the proximity to the magnetic poles.

The most important point is ‘light pollution’, it will ruin any aurora show,
so the best places to watch the auroras should be away from light pollution.
In most cases in the north this usually only requires driving for 30 minutes of a city/town and you should be in light
pollution free skies.<br><br>

The other most important is to be on relatively high ground with an un-obscured view north
(this is not necessary if you are so far North the auroras are usually directly overhead).

The further away from the north pole you are, generally speaking the lower on the horizon the aurora will be.

Of course this depends on a lot of factors such as aurora strength (Kp level).<br><br>

Those are really the main points to successful aurora viewing, if you get them all right,
then you should be in for a good show. Of course if there are clouds, then forget all the above!
Auroras are not visible through most types clouds.
